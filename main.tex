\begin{abstract}
The upcoming research in the Gravitational Wave domain has introduced new challenges to Astronomy and has opened a new window to the universe.

Our work here looks for a way to harness the power of multi-messenger astronomy to enhance and complement the incredible capabilities of the new generation of GW detectors, with LVC leading the way.

It will hopefully help newcomers to the field to understand the details and challenges of this new discipline and encourage research in the area. \textcolor{red}{[This is probably too pedantic]}

In the first chapter, I introduce the concepts and frame on which my thesis developed.

In the second chapter, I discuss the two main elements of a modern transient search. That is, Image Difference and Machine Learning classification.

\chapter{Introduction}

In February 2016, celebrating the centenary anniversary of Einstein's first paper on gravitational waves(``Approximate integration of the field equations of gravitation''), the LVC collaboration announced the first ever direct detection of a gravitational wave, labeled GW150914.
With this, a new window of the universe for the purely relativistic astronomical phenomena was opened. 

The history of GW was not without controversies. From the discussion of whether GW would carry energy to the experiments of Joseph Weber, Gravitational Waves made its way from the theoretical realm into a stronghold position in Astrophysics.

The detection of GW150914 firmly established the base for a new kind of Astronomy.
Years to come will turn GW detection, into a full field GW Astronomy.

There is a new messenger in the universe that is purely relativistic in nature. The graviton and its wave counterpart will bring us information about high gravitational fields, compact massive objects, relativistic speed phenomena and more.
It will let us probe into the physics of the extreme gravitational field astronomical bodies.

The GW information will complete, refine and expand our understanding of our universe.
It will complement our telescopes in the radio, visible and every other frequency band. 
Optical Astronomy has become an even more important partner in this search.
Together they will uncover even more details of the inner mechanisms of the celestial bodies.

In the following sections, I offer a brief introduction of GWs and their relation to Optical Astronomy.

\section{Gravitational Waves}

\begin{comment}

%Quadrupole radiation is the lowest allowed form and is thus usually the dominant form. In this case, the GW field strength is proportional to the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of the source, and it falls off in amplitude inversely with distance from the source.

%As with electromagnetic waves, GWs travel at the speed of light and are transverse in character, i.e. the strain oscillations occur in directions orthogonal to the direction in which the wave is propagating.
\end{comment}

General Relativity predicts that very massive or energetic events will create traveling perturbations of the underlying spacetime metric in the form of gravitational waves.
These are linear disturbances to a flat background metric, that are propagated outwards with the speed of light fading with the inverse of the distance.
These tensorial transversal waves will modify the local metric as it travels through space.

Putting it in more technical terms, in an asymptotically flat spacetime, removed from any strong source so that one can assume an almost flat local solution, one can study weak perturbations to the flat Minkowski metric.
In this regime, the linearized Einstein field equations admit wave solutions.
These wave solutions are called Gravitational Waves. \textcolor{red}{Add who coined the term for the first time, it's in the review.}

The GW metric has the form: (we refer the reader to Appendix \ref{gwderivation} for a more complete derivation of the metric)

\begin{equation}
h_{\mu \nu} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & h_{+}e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & h_{\times} e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & -h_{+}e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\textcolor{red}{Talk about the two polarizations}

Since a spacetime metric is a measure of distance between pair of events, the metric perturbation wave will modify the relative distance between points in space as it passes by. 
It is in fact an effective oscillating strain or tidal force between free test masses.
One could then devise an instrument set to detect these relative differences in distance for such test masses.

But because of the very `perturbative' nature of GW, these differences are very small. 
To have any chance of detection, one must look into the extreme side of gravity: very massive compact astrophysical objects with big gravitational fields, moving at relativistic velocities.
Even the most powerful astronomical events, like a black hole merger will produce disturbances of $10^{-23}$ m at a few hundreds Mpc of distance.

Perhaps the first experimental evidence for the existence of GWs came 50 years after their prediction with the work of Husel and Taylor. For decades, they studied the pulses we receive from one Neutron Star (NS) in a Neutron Star Binary (NSB).
They discovered that the slow rate of period decrease of the pulses precisely matched General Relativity predictions. \textcolor{red}{To Add: It was a Nobel Prize work. It settled the debate on whether GW carry energy or not. The decrease in period rate is proof that the energy is radiated away into GW.}

Nonetheless, a direct detection of GW wouldn't come for another 50 years.
In September 14, 2015, a GW detection labeled GW150914 was finally made by the LIGO Collaboration.

Direct detection {\em in situ} of GW requires a transducer of GW in some other form measurable by common instruments.

One pioneer work along this line was the work done by Joseph Weber in the late 1960s and early 70s. He proposed using a 2 meters in length and 1 meter in diameter aluminium cylinder, that would resonate with passing GW at 1660 Hz.
These tiny resonant oscillations could in principle be measured. Even though ingenious, the carefully devised experiment could not yield positive reproducible results that convinced the scientific community. \textcolor{red}{Maybe add that there were still attempts at cryogenic resonators into the 90s?}

A whole other category of these instruments are the ones based in the interferometry of lasers running on two long arms. Several of this kind are built on different parts of the planet. A few are planned to be built in the future. Most notably is the case of Lisa, a proposed GW interferometer to be set in space trailing the Earth's orbit.

Interferometer GW detectors transduce a GW warp in space to the shrinking and stretching of relative distances of masses put far apart in two or more long interferometers. 
In the case of the Earth based observatories, each interferometer is one arm several kilometers long, of an L shape facility.
The masses are the end mirrors that reflect a laser beam pointed in each arm direction. 
On normal circumstances, the beams from two different arms can be set to be (`locked') on a dark or bright fringe of the interferometer diffraction pattern.
When a GW passes by, it will alter the relative distances of the mirror masses, thus changing the optical path of the laser beams. This in turn, will translate into a shift in the diffraction pattern consistent with the deformation of space.

In the following section I offer a more detailed account on the the operation of the first of these Earth based interferometers, the LIGO observatory.


\section{The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration}

\begin{comment}
The following text is mine, but too convoluted

The test masses for LIGO are two massive mirrors at the end of two perpendicular long arms (4 km long.) Each mirror weighs about 40 kg and each one of the arms can be thought, for simplicity, as an independent laser interferometer.

When a GW passes at an angle to this set-up, the arms will stretch and shorten in opposite directions (one arm will stretch as the other shrinks), while the laser keeps traveling the arms unaffected. This causes minuscule differences in optical paths for the light and this in turn will result in the lasers being out of phase from each other. This difference in phase from the `lock' position indicates a change in the relative positions of the mirrors.

Many other mundane situations can also produce this same effect, the most simple one being seismic activity of almost any strength. Additionally, noise from the instrument itself, from the laser beam and electronics, as well as many intrinsic vibration modes of the system complicates the output signal that will be analyzed.
\end{comment}

LIGO --the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory-- (Abramovici et al. 1992) is an American observatory set to detect the GW predicted by General Relativity.

It actually consists of two separate observatories, one in the state of Washington and another one in Louisiana.

Co-founded in 1992 by Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech and Rainer Weiss of MIT, LIGO is a joint project between scientists at MIT, Caltech, and many other colleges and universities.

Virgo is a similar observatory in Europe. Originally a project from France and Italy, it soon became a collaboration from five different countries: France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Hungary. The Virgo observatory is located in the countryside near Pisa, Italy.

Since 2007, LIGO and Virgo share their data in an umbrella collaboration named LVC, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration.

Even though, LIGO and Virgo have comparable noise levels and detection rates, only the two interferometers in LIGO were operational at the time of the GW150914 event. 
In fact, Virgo was being upgraded to Advanced Virgo, which will have a sensitivity 10 times greater than Initial Virgo. 
When the upgrade is finished, it will join LIGO in the joint collection of GW data. This will improve errors in the parameter estimation, especially localization errors will greatly improve.

LIGO went through similar upgrades along the years.

The initial LIGO detectors were designed to be sensitive to GWs in the frequency band 40-7000 Hz, and capable of detecting a GW strain amplitude as small as $10^{-21}$.

To picture the order of magnitude of these displacements, consider that the change in length of one arm of the interferometer is only about $10^{-18}$ m, a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a proton.

To reach this sensitivity, the detectors need highly stable lasers, multiple layers of vibration isolation and advanced optic techniques.

From the initial period, LIGO had five short science runs (S1 to S5), each one improving over the previous one, culminating with S5 at design sensitivity. 
The S5 run collected a full year of triple-detector coincident data from November 2005 to September 2007.

Between Initial LIGO and Advanced LIGO more science were made under Enhanced LIGO, which provided enhancements that improved sensitivity by a factor of 2. 

But the real revolution came with Advanced LIGO, a set of additions that improved LIGO sensitivity by a factor of 10 over Initial LIGO and widened the frequency range all the way down to 10 Hz (which is known as the seismic wall).


Among the improvements is the upgrading of the laser wattage to 200 W. 
An increase in the test masses to 40 kg in order to reduce radiation pressure noise and to allow larger beam sizes. 
Larger beams and better dielectric mirror coatings combine to reduce the test mass thermal noise by a factor of 5 compared with initial LIGO.
An improvement in vibration isolation, including vertical isolation comparable to the horizontal isolation all almost all stages.
New suspension system based on fused silica rather than steel wires to reduce suspension thermal noise by almost a hundred.
New two-stage active seismic isolation instead of the passive one-stage isolation brought the seismic noise to negligible levels above approximately 10 Hz.

All these improvements combined gave Advanced LIGO a 10-fold increase in sensitivity. 
This increase also means that fainter sources can now be detected, increasing the exploration volume for GW by a factor of a thousand.

Advanced LIGO will have several observations runs, labelled O1 through OX, (similar to the scientific runs S1-S5) with gaps between them on which more improvements will be implemented until it reaches design sensitivity in OX. 

The projected sensitivity for each of the runs is presented in table X

\begin{comment}
%The successful operation of Advanced LIGO is expected to transform the field from GW detection to GW astrophysics. We illustrate the potential using compact binary coalescences. Detection rate estimates for CBCs can be made using a combination of extrapolations from observed binary pulsars, stellar birth rate estimates and population synthesis models. There are large uncertainties inherent in all of these methods, however, leading to rate estimates that are uncertain by several orders of magnitude. We therefore quote a range of rates, spanning plausible pessimistic and optimistic estimates, as well as a likely rate. For a NS mass of 1.4M⊙ and a BH mass of 10M⊙, these rate estimates for Advanced LIGO are: 0.4– 400 yr−1, with a likely rate of 40 yr−1 for NS–NS binaries; 0.2–300 yr−1 , with a likely rate of 10 yr−1 for NS–BH binaries; 2–4000 yr−1 , with a likely rate of 30 yr−1 for BH–BH binaries.

LIGO was designed so that its data could be searched for GWs from many different sources. The sources can be broadly characterized as either transient or continuous in nature, and for each type, the analysis techniques depend on whether the gravitational waveforms can be accurately modeled or whether only less specific spectral characterizations are possible. We therefore organize the searches into four categories according to source type and analysis technique.
%(i) Transient, modeled waveforms: the compact binary coalescence search. The name follows from the fact that the best understood transient sources are the final stages of binary inspirals [52], where each component of the binary may be a NS or a BH. For these sources the waveform can be calculated with good precision, and matched-filter analysis can be used.
(ii) Transient, unmodeled waveforms: the gravitational-wave bursts search. Transient systems, such as core-collapse supernovae [53], BH mergers and NS quakes, may produce GW bursts that can only be modeled imperfectly, if at all, and more general analysis techniques are needed.
(iii) Continuous, narrow-band waveforms: the continuous wave sources search. An example of a continuous source of GWs with a well-modeled waveform is a spinning NS (e.g. a pulsar) that is not perfectly symmetric about its rotation axis [54].
(iv) Continuous, broadband waveforms: the gravitational-wave background search. Processes operating in the early universe, for example, could have produced a background of GWs that is continuous but stochastic in character [55].

\section{The TOROS Collaboration \textcolor{red}{(or project?)}}
* Lengthy TOROS Description (whatever it evolved into at this point)

TOROS, the Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South, is a collaboration formed to respond to GW events as detected by the LVC.
Its main purpose then is to detect transient events compatible with expected (or not) signatures of events that can give mutual birth to GW and optical triggers.

Being in its early stages of development, and given the new nature of the multi-messenger astronomy, the TOROS team is building up the tools and infrastructure that will make it capable in the future to promptly respond to this alerts.

Several things can enter in consideration for this task, from software development to forging ties with existing observatories. 

My thesis will focus on several challenges in the development of the software infrastructure needed to process the observatory data. 

At the moment of this writing, TOROS Collaboration consists of several astronomical institutions that showed interest in doing a search and possible follow-ups of candidates to interesting events.

The list of participant institutions is as follows: (should I list them?)

At UT Rio Grande Valley, we developed extensive analysis and web code to allow for the interaction between the institutions (just the broker page, really).

\section{Optimal Image Subtraction}
	
OIS (Optimal Image Subtraction) is a Python module that implements several Difference Image Analysis methods as described in section X.

It works on Numpy arrays, so that way is agnostic on what is the source of the image. 

Bad pixels that need to be ignored in the image are marked using Numpy's masked arrays (True on bad pixel).

The interface to the user has two entry points: the module methods optimal\_system and subtract\_on\_grid. The latter is just a convenient method to partition the image in a certain grid and perform the former on each grid, taking into account pixels outside the grid when necessary.

\appendix
\chapter{Derivation of the Gravitational Wave Equations} \label{gwderivation}

Gravitational waves are a particular kind of solution to the Einstein's field equations of General Relativity.

In many situations we can consider, we are in a flat background situation, in which our metric does not differ much locally from the Minkowski metric.
Suppose we are far away, removed from any strong source in an asymptotically flat spacetime.

In such situation we can assume that locally our metric is the Minkowski metric $\eta$ plus some small deviation $h$. We want to study the dynamics of such small perturbation in a linearized Einstein field equation. 


To do that, we consider the metric $g = \eta + h$ in the linearized Einstein's field equations. Linearized here means that quadratic and higher factors of $h$ will be simply ignored, as they are assumed much smaller than the flat metric.

Let's find out what condition the Einstein field equation $G_{\mu \nu}(\eta + h) = 8\pi T_{\mu \nu} = 0$ imposes on this small perturbation $h$.

%\begin{align}
%G_{\mu \nu}(\eta + h) = 8\pi T_{\mu \nu} = 0
%\end{align}

%It is worth noting here that Einstein equations are not linear in nature, but they are second order on the metric derivatives and furthermore linear on the second order terms. This will allow us to derive from the linearized Einstein equations, a second order wave equation on the small perturbation $h$ that decouples from $\eta$.

%Another issue to point out is that the vague definition of 'small perturbation' has to be of physical nature and not an artifact on the choice of the coordinate system. We will not worry about this issue on the present work, but it is worth keeping it in mind. Other concerns about coordinate system effects were historically raised and settled in time, particularly the many gauge choices done during the derivation.

The Christoffel symbols to first order in $h$ are:

\begin{align}
\Gamma_{abc} &= \frac{1}{2} \left( g_{ca,b} + g_{cb,a} - g_{ab,c} \right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} \left( (\eta + h)_{ca,b} + (\eta + h)_{cb,a} - (\eta + h)_{ab,c} \right) \\
 &=\frac{1}{2} \left( h_{ca,b} + h_{cb,a} - h_{ab,c} \right) 
\end{align}

At this point we must note that we will still call $g^{ab}$ the inverse of $g_{ab}$, which is $g^{ab} = \eta^{ab} - h^{ab}$ to first order in $h$. 

And thus,
\begin{align}
\Gamma^{a}_{bc} &= g^{cd} \Gamma_{abd} \\
 &=(\eta - h)^{cd} \Gamma_{abd} \\
 &= \frac{1}{2} \eta^{cd} \left( h_{ca,b} + h_{cb,a} - h_{ab,c} \right) + \order(h^2)
\end{align}

Similarly, the Ricci tensor to first order in $h$ will be:

\begin{align}
R_{ab} &= \Gamma^{c}_{ab,c} - \Gamma^{c}_{cb,a} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left( h_{a}{}^{c}{}_{,bc} + h_{b}{}^{c}{}_{,ac} - h_{ab,c}{}^{c} - h_{c}{}^{c}{}_{,ab} \right)
\end{align}

Which will finally lead us to the Einstein's tensor $G$:

\begin{align}
G_{ab} &= R_{ab} - \frac{1}{2}g_{ab}R \\
&= R_{ab} - \frac{1}{2}\eta_{ab}R + \order(h^2) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left( h_{ac,b}{}^{c} + h_{bc,a}{}^{c} - h_{ab,c}{}^{c} - h_{c}{}^{c}{}_{,ab} -\eta_{ab} \left( h_{cd,}{}^{cd} - h_{c}{}^{c}{}_{,d}{}^{d} \right) \right)
\end{align}

This can be brought to a shorter form defining $\bar{h}{}_{ab} = h_{ab} - \eta_{ab} h$

Where $h = h_{c}{}^{c}$ is the trace of the metric tensor $h$.
With this definition, the Einstein's field equation becomes:

\begin{align}
\bar{h}{}_{ab,c}{}^{c} + \bar{h}{}_{ac,b}{}^{c} + \bar{h}{}_{bc,a}{}^{c} -\eta_{ab} \bar{h}{}_{cd,}{}^{cd} = 0
\end{align}

\section{Gauge choices}

There is a gauge freedom in General Relativity corresponding to the group of diffeomorphisms, that can be used to simplify the equations even more. Just like the Gauge freedom in electrodynamics $A \rightarrow A + \partial \chi$ we can chose $h$ to satisfy $\bar{h}{}_{ab,}{}^{b} = 0$

In this ``Lorentz Gauge'', the linearized Einstein field equations, reduce to the usual wave equation for each component of $\bar{h}$:

\begin{align}
\bar{h}_{ab,c}{}^{c} = \Box{\bar{h}{}_{ab}} = 0
\end{align}

Further gauge choices can let us choose the trace of $\bar{h}$ to be zero and each $h_{0\mu}$ component to be zero for $\mu = 0,1,2,3$. Notice that once the trace of $\bar{h}$ is set to zero, it implies that $\bar{h}{}_{ab} = h_{ab}$

\begin{align} \label{gaugecond}
& \Box{h_{ab}} = 0 \\
& h_{ab,}{}^{b} = 0 \\
& h_{a}{}^{a} = 0 \\
& h_{0 \mu} = 0; \; \mu=0,1,2,3
\end{align}

This is called the transverse traceless (TT) gauge. The reader can refer the full derivation for the gauge choices in Misner or Wald.

With the conditions in (\ref{gaugecond}), we seek solutions in the form of plane waves of the form $h_{ab} = H_{ab}e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}}$.

Our gauge conditions impose similar conditions on $k$ and $H$:

\begin{align}
& k^{\mu} H_{\mu \nu} = 0 \\
& H_{\mu}{}^{\mu} = 0 \\
& H_{0 \mu} = 0; \; \mu=0,1,2,3
\end{align}

This leaves $H$ with only two independent components. If we consider a wave propagating in the z direction, the most general form for a transverse traceless metric will be:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & h_{+} & h_{\times} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} & -h_{+} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}}
\end{equation}

and the total metric $g$

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 + h_{+}e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & h_{\times} e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 1 - h_{+}e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The two independent polarizations are called ``h plus'' ($h_+$) and ``h cross'' ($h_{\times}$).
