\chapter{Introduction}

In February 2016, celebrating the centenary anniversary of Einstein's first paper on gravitational waves(``Approximate integration of the field equations of gravitation''), the LVC collaboration announced the first ever direct detection of a gravitational wave, labeled GW150914.
With this, a new window of the universe for the purely relativistic astronomical phenomena was opened. 

The history of GW was not without controversies. From the discussion of whether GW would carry energy to the experiments of Joseph Weber, Gravitational Waves made its way from the theoretical realm into a stronghold position in Astrophysics.

The detection of GW150914 firmly established the base for a new kind of Astronomy.
Years to come will turn GW detection, into a full field GW Astronomy.

There is a new messenger in the universe that is purely relativistic in nature. The graviton and its wave counterpart will bring us information about high gravitational fields, compact massive objects, relativistic speed phenomena and more.
It will let us probe into the physics of the extreme gravitational field astronomical bodies.

The GW information will complete, refine and expand the understanding of our universe.
It will complement our telescopes in the radio, visible and every other frequency band. 
Optical Astronomy has become an even more important partner in this search.
Together they will uncover even more details of the inner mechanisms of the celestial bodies and their interactions.

In the following sections, I offer a brief introduction of GWs and their relation to Optical Astronomy.

\section{Gravitational Waves}

\begin{comment}

%Quadrupole radiation is the lowest allowed form and is thus usually the dominant form. In this case, the GW field strength is proportional to the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of the source, and it falls off in amplitude inversely with distance from the source.

%As with electromagnetic waves, GWs travel at the speed of light and are transverse in character, i.e. the strain oscillations occur in directions orthogonal to the direction in which the wave is propagating.
\end{comment}

General Relativity predicts that very massive or energetic events will create traveling perturbations of the underlying spacetime metric in the form of gravitational waves.
These are linear disturbances on a flat background metric, that are propagated outwards with the speed of light fading with the inverse of the distance.
These tensorial transversal waves will modify the local metric as it travels through space.

Putting it in more technical terms, in an asymptotically flat spacetime, removed from any strong source so that one can assume an almost flat local solution, one can study weak perturbations to the flat Minkowski metric.
In this regime, the linearized Einstein field equations admit wave solutions.
These wave solutions are called Gravitational Waves. \textcolor{red}{Add who coined the term for the first time, it's in the review.}

The GW tensor metric in the TT gauge coordinate frame, has the form: (we refer the reader to Appendix \ref{gwderivation} for a more complete derivation of the metric)

\begin{equation}
h_{\mu \nu} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & h_{+}e^{\pm i k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & h_{\times} e^{\pm i k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} e^{\pm i k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & -h_{+}e^{\pm i k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\textcolor{red}{Talk about the two polarizations}

Since a spacetime metric is a measure of distance between pair of events, the metric perturbation wave will modify the relative distance between points in space as it passes by. 
It is in fact an effective oscillating strain or tidal force between free test masses.
One could then devise an instrument set to detect these relative differences in distance for such test masses.

But because of the very `perturbative' nature of GW, these differences are very small. 
To have any chance of detection, one must look into the extreme side of gravity: very massive compact astrophysical objects with big gravitational fields, moving at relativistic velocities.
Even the most powerful astronomical events, like a black hole merger will produce disturbances of $10^{-23}$ m at a few hundreds Mpc of distance.

Perhaps the first experimental evidence for the existence of GWs came 50 years after their prediction with the work of Husel and Taylor. For decades, they studied the pulses we receive from one Neutron Star (NS) in a Neutron Star Binary (NSB).
They discovered that the slow rate of period decrease of the pulses precisely matched General Relativity predictions. \textcolor{red}{To Add: It was a Nobel Prize work. It settled the debate on whether GW carry energy or not. The decrease in period rate is proof that the energy is radiated away into GW.}

Nonetheless, a direct detection of GW wouldn't come for another 50 years.
In September 14, 2015, a GW detection labeled GW150914 was finally made by the LIGO Collaboration.

Direct detection {\em in situ} of GW requires a transducer of GW in some other form measurable by common instruments.

One pioneer work along this line was the work done by Joseph Weber in the late 1960s and early 70s. He proposed using a 2 meters in length and 1 meter in diameter aluminium cylinder, that would resonate with passing GW at 1660 Hz.
These tiny resonant oscillations could in principle be measured. Even though ingenious, the carefully devised experiment could not yield positive reproducible results that convinced the scientific community. \textcolor{red}{Maybe add that there were still attempts at cryogenic resonators into the 90s?}

A whole other category of these instruments are the ones based in the interferometry of lasers running on two long arms. Several of this kind are built on different parts of the planet. A few are planned to be built in the future. Most notably is the case of Lisa, a proposed GW interferometer to be set in space trailing the Earth's orbit.

Interferometer GW detectors transduce a GW warp in space to the shrinking and stretching of relative distances of masses put far apart in two or more --mostly perpendicular-- long interferometers. 
In the case of the Earth based observatories, each interferometer is one arm several kilometers long, of an L shape facility.
The masses are the end mirrors that reflect a laser beam pointed in each arm direction. 
On normal circumstances, the beams from two different arms can be set to be (`locked') on a dark or bright fringe of the interferometer diffraction pattern.
When a GW passes by, it will alter the relative distances of the mirror masses, thus changing the optical path of the laser beams. This in turn, will translate into a shift in the diffraction pattern consistent with the deformation of space.

In the following section I offer a more detailed account on the the operation of the first of these Earth based interferometers, the LIGO observatory.

\section{The Transient World and the Time-Domain Revolution in Astronomy}

In this so-called ``Information Age'', data is king.
As we move away from the traditional one person project and manual way to deal with the information, the amount of data that needs processing becomes unmanageable by humans. 
This is not to say that individual work has no place in science, 
but that the collective gathering of information becomes more ubiquitous in science.

Astronomy has not been immune to information overload. 
The sizes of sky surveys have been increasing steadily and dramatically over the years.
From 0.1 TB and about 10 to 100 events per night now, to about 30 TB and $10^5$ to $10^6$ events per night in the LSST era, the data load and the resources to process them become overwhelming if not done by automated agents.

The big amount of data posses yet another challenge.
The identification of interesting objects of study among countless other events on the sky.
This `mining' or harvesting problem have been tackled by other disciplines by different techniques of many kinds.
They are collectively called ``Data Mining'' or ``Machine Learning'' as well as other names depending on the specific field and purpose.
Classification problems done by automated agents trained for that purpose are usually dealt within the techniques called ``Machine Learning'', and we will devote a great deal of this thesis on such field.

Rare events interesting to a particular survey or telescope must then be identified against the stationary or slowly varying sky, and must be separated from other transients of a different kind.

Perhaps, one of the most spectacular of these transient events because of its  display of brightness and energy, are the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs).

The brightness of this flash of gamma-rays can temporarily overwhelm all other gamma-ray sources in the Universe. The burst can last from a fraction of a second to over a thousand seconds. 

GRBs are explosions as energetic as $10^?$ ergs, liberated Gamma Rays and subsequent afterglows across the whole spectrum up to Radio frequencies.

The afterglows for GRBs can be seen in the optical as a transient brightness excess, usually located near the galaxies that host them. GRBs can be at extremely distant galaxies, and therefore optical glows can sometimes be too faint to observe.

Since the detection of the first few of these, now we have two space telescopes dedicated to find them.

To detect the optical afterglow, GRB locations were communicated to other observatories that would promptly point their telescopes in that direction.
A multi-band observation and spectrography is very valuable for the understanding and classification of these events.

The value of multi-messenger astronomy of this kind was recognized right on the onset for the understanding and classification of these events.

With the new GW detections of LIGO, a new kind of multimessenger Astronomy is born.
LIGO will bring information of a completely new information carrier: the {\em graviton}.
With GW information we can pierce into the high energetic and ultra relativistic regions in space, something that could not be done before.

It is then very important to complement such information with the EM counterpart.
Both, the GW and the EM information can bring up a more complete picture of the phenomena at hand.
Together they can give us an understanding richer than the sum of their separate contributions.
Even more, EM counterparts can most notably help where GW information fails harder, in localization.
Localization by means of the EM counterpart, not only helps on this few parameters of the position in the sky, but will also help to separate the uncertainty correlation on the geometrical disposition of a merger, for example.
This way, improving other estimates of the merge.

Such classification of transient events is nowadays done with the aid of classification agents trained with Machine Learning techniques.


\textcolor{blue}{As the data and event discovery rates increase dramatically, from about 0.1 TB and about 10 to 100 events per night now, to about 30 TB and $10^5$ to $10^6$ events per night in the LSST [4] era, available follow-up facilities would be simply overwhelmed, and unable to react to all potentially interesting events.}

\begin{comment}
The new enabling technologies will be automated or robotized.

Rare events will be harvested, or mined in the jargon of big-data, from huge data sets.

The time periods on which variability occurs range from seconds to tens or hundreds of days, as for Super Novae (SN).

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) are transient events ...

An important consideration on information retrieval, is how will data be process to detect the target objects in the survey.

(Blue is from Hotwiring the transient universe)

\textcolor{blue}{Essentially every field of astrophysics is touched and enhanced with the exploration of the time domain, and many interesting phenomena can be only studied in the time domain.}


\textcolor{blue}{The essential enabling technologies will be automated, robust classification and decision making for the optimal use of follow-up facilities. Given the exponential growth of data rates, the traditional ``manual'' approach from the past will simply not scale to the next generation of surveys, especially if one is interested in the rarer transients.}

\textcolor{blue}{a broad diversity of the fundamentally different physical phenomena look the same at the instance of their event detection, e.g., a ``new'' or a much brighter point source relative to the baseline image.}

\textcolor{blue}{As we have conducted more comprehensive surveys, it has become clear that there are rapid changes in the distant Universe with durations measured in days or even seconds, and that those ephemeral changes provide important clues about the nature and evolution of our Universe}

Variability of the sky usually refers to changes in brightness, \textcolor{blue}{but the position or color of the object could vary instead or as well.}

\textcolor{blue}{Other objects display primarily astrometric variability rather than photometric variability - objects in our solar system display motions visible on timescales between seconds to hours}

\textcolor{blue}{There are vastly different time periods available for detecting different kinds of variable or transient objects. The optical counterparts of gamma ray bursts brighten quickly within minutes to hours then fade over hours to days, while supernovae brighten over a period of hours to days and then fade over a period of tens to hundreds of days; neither of these events repeat. M-dwarf flares occur and disappear within minutes but recur often although unpredictably, while periodic variables may vary on a timescale between hours to days but repeat on a definite schedule, making it possible to phase observations from different periods back together.}

\textcolor{blue}{Due to hardware limitations (smaller telescopes, smaller fields of view), most past surveys have focused on one primary science goal. Still, the data from many of these projects has been adopted to search for many other kinds of variable or transient objects. Three surveys which were originally designed to search for potentially hazardous NEOs - the Lowell Observatory Near Earth Object Survey (LONEOS)[6], the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) survey [22] and the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS)[17] - have (respectively) been used to discover RR Lyrae [20], joined in collaboration with the Palomar-Quest survey [10] to provide supernova candidates for the Nearby Supernova Factory [2], and serve as the source of data searched for all kinds of variability in the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) [11].}

\textcolor{blue}{However, there is yet another twist - how to identify the target objects of interest among the background of millions of other potential variable or transient objects? ... this results in a pool of candidates contaminated with other variables or transients. Reducing that contamination requires additional observational data either to determine the full shape of the transient or variable lightcurve, or to determine the velocity and acceleration vectors of a solar system object, or to determine the spectral energy distribution of the object through observations at multiple wavelengths or in multiple filters.
The process of winnowing out the contaminants and identifying the true members of the target sample is the heart of ``classification''}

\textcolor{blue}{A final consideration when planning a synoptic survey is how to process the data to detect the target objects in the survey. Briefly summarized, methods for detection of variables or transients boil down to generating a catalog of objects which are `different' (in brightness or position) in an image acquired from the survey telescope from what is expected for that region of sky. One common method is to create a `template image' from a series of images previously obtained of the same field, match this template to the image from the telescope being searched for variables or transients, and then to subtract the two to create a difference image. The matching process must include matching the point-spread function of the template and science image, as well as aligning their coordinate systems. Source detection algorithms are then run on the difference image to look for objects which varied in brightness or position between the template and science image. Another common method is to create calibrated catalogs from each image directly, match objects from the catalogs created from each image with the same objects from the other catalogs using spatial correlations, and again look for things which vary in brightness or position. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, among which are: difference imaging is typically more computationally expensive but does well at removing extended non-variable objects such as galaxies, can detect variability in non-stellar profiles, and can perform better in crowded fields, while catalog searches require more accurate calibration but do not require template images and can be used to search for variability in data from different telescopes.}

\textcolor{blue}{It is interesting to see the progression that has occurred, from searching for a particular target population (such as Type Ia SNe or Near Earth Objects or Trans-Neptunian Objects) to searching for a wide variety of objects. Current or imminent synoptic surveys, such as the Palomar Transient Factory [18], [23], Skymapper [16] and PanStarrs1 (PS) [9], and significantly larger future synoptic surveys, such as PanStarrs-4 and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) [15], [19], will be searching for all kinds of known transients and variables, as well as previously unknown objects where the requirements for understanding these `unknown unknowns' are still developing.}


\textcolor{blue}{Balancing the requirements for detecting and identifying a wide range of transients and variables is challenging, but these surveys are planning to meet the challenge with multi-color observations (typically some or all of u, g, r, i, z and y filters) over large portions of the sky (approximately 20,000 square degrees). Very large fields of view (7-10 square degrees) will allow these surveys to cover the sky on a rapid observational cadence; while the base plan is to cover all of the visible sky every few days (for LSST) or subsets of the visible sky every few days (PS4), it is likely that an entire range of revisit times between a few hours to several days may be explored for greater sensitivity to variability at a wider range of timescales. Data processing will be intensive - difference imaging will be used to detect transients and variables, and then software pipelines will run to identify moving objects, linking their detections into orbits. Accurate calibration of photometry and astrometry on a global reference scale requires more processing. LSST will send out public VOEvents describing the millions of transient and variable detections each night. Huge databases (upwards of 12 PB for LSST at the end of its 10 year survey) of objects and all of their detections will be created and available for queries. Users will be able to use this database to identify and classify the target samples of interest to them, as well as access the VOEvent stream to get real-time updates on targets.}

\textcolor{blue}{More than ten years ago, the gamma-ray burst (GRB) community ignited the excitement over transient astronomical events. GRBs were an enigma until ultra-fast event dissemination allowed optical identification of afterglows, leading to rich data and rich science.}
\textcolor{red}{Talk about era of information}
\textcolor{blue}{Thus we expect the infrastructure for astronomical transients to allow end-users to select in advance what types of events they want, and we expect specialist ``event brokers'' that disseminate only certain kinds of transients to their target audiences. Such dissemination should happen quickly, so that the essential telescope resources can be directed for follow-up, and we expect these decisions to be taken automatically by machines.}

\textcolor{blue}{the IVOA has settled on a flavor of XML called VOEvent for the transmission of astronomical events, and processing those would need XML streaming and filtering technologies.}

\section{The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration}

\begin{comment}
The following text is mine, but too convoluted

The test masses for LIGO are two massive mirrors at the end of two perpendicular long arms (4 km long.) Each mirror weighs about 40 kg and each one of the arms can be thought, for simplicity, as an independent laser interferometer.

When a GW passes at an angle to this set-up, the arms will stretch and shorten in opposite directions (one arm will stretch as the other shrinks), while the laser keeps traveling the arms unaffected. This causes minuscule differences in optical paths for the light and this in turn will result in the lasers being out of phase from each other. This difference in phase from the `lock' position indicates a change in the relative positions of the mirrors.

Many other mundane situations can also produce this same effect, the most simple one being seismic activity of almost any strength. Additionally, noise from the instrument itself, from the laser beam and electronics, as well as many intrinsic vibration modes of the system complicates the output signal that will be analyzed.
\end{comment}

LIGO --the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory-- (Abramovici et al. 1992) is an American observatory set to detect the GW predicted by General Relativity.

It actually consists of two separate observatories, one in the state of Washington and another one in Louisiana.

Co-founded in 1992 by Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech and Rainer Weiss of MIT, LIGO is a joint project between scientists at MIT, Caltech, and many other colleges and universities.

Virgo is a similar observatory in Europe. Originally a project from France and Italy, it soon became a collaboration from five different countries: France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Hungary. The Virgo observatory is located in the countryside near Pisa, Italy.

Since 2007, LIGO and Virgo share their data in an umbrella collaboration named LVC, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration.

Even though, LIGO and Virgo have comparable noise levels and detection rates, only the two interferometers in LIGO were operational at the time of the GW150914 event. 
In fact, Virgo was being upgraded to Advanced Virgo, which will have a sensitivity 10 times greater than Initial Virgo. 
When the upgrade is finished, it will join LIGO in the joint collection of GW data. This will improve errors in the parameter estimation, especially localization errors will greatly improve.

LIGO went through similar upgrades along the years.

The initial LIGO detectors were designed to be sensitive to GWs in the frequency band 40-7000 Hz, and capable of detecting a GW strain amplitude as small as $10^{-21}$.

To picture the order of magnitude of these displacements, consider that the change in length of one arm of the interferometer is only about $10^{-18}$ m, a thousand times smaller than the diameter of a proton.

To reach this sensitivity, the detectors need highly stable lasers, multiple layers of vibration isolation and advanced optic techniques.

From the initial period, LIGO had five short science runs (S1 to S5), each one improving over the previous one, culminating with S5 at design sensitivity. 
The S5 run collected a full year of triple-detector coincident data from November 2005 to September 2007.

Between Initial LIGO and Advanced LIGO more science were made under Enhanced LIGO, which provided enhancements that improved sensitivity by a factor of 2. 

But the real revolution came with Advanced LIGO, a set of additions that improved LIGO sensitivity by a factor of 10 over Initial LIGO and widened the frequency range all the way down to 10 Hz (which is known as the seismic wall).


Among the improvements is the upgrading of the laser wattage to 200 W. 
An increase in the test masses to 40 kg in order to reduce radiation pressure noise and to allow larger beam sizes. 
Larger beams and better dielectric mirror coatings combine to reduce the test mass thermal noise by a factor of 5 compared with initial LIGO.
An improvement in vibration isolation, including vertical isolation comparable to the horizontal isolation all almost all stages.
New suspension system based on fused silica rather than steel wires to reduce suspension thermal noise by almost a hundred.
New two-stage active seismic isolation instead of the passive one-stage isolation brought the seismic noise to negligible levels above approximately 10 Hz.

All these improvements combined gave Advanced LIGO a 10-fold increase in sensitivity. 
This increase also means that fainter sources can now be detected, increasing the exploration volume for GW by a factor of a thousand.

Advanced LIGO will have several observations runs, labelled O1, O2, etc. (similar to the scientific runs S1-S5) with gaps between them on which more improvements will be implemented until it reaches design sensitivity.

The projected sensitivity for each of the runs is presented in table \ref{ligoruns}

\begin{comment}
%The successful operation of Advanced LIGO is expected to transform the field from GW detection to GW astrophysics. We illustrate the potential using compact binary coalescences. Detection rate estimates for CBCs can be made using a combination of extrapolations from observed binary pulsars, stellar birth rate estimates and population synthesis models. There are large uncertainties inherent in all of these methods, however, leading to rate estimates that are uncertain by several orders of magnitude. We therefore quote a range of rates, spanning plausible pessimistic and optimistic estimates, as well as a likely rate. For a NS mass of 1.4M⊙ and a BH mass of 10M⊙, these rate estimates for Advanced LIGO are: 0.4– 400 yr−1, with a likely rate of 40 yr−1 for NS–NS binaries; 0.2–300 yr−1 , with a likely rate of 10 yr−1 for NS–BH binaries; 2–4000 yr−1 , with a likely rate of 30 yr−1 for BH–BH binaries.

LIGO was designed so that its data could be searched for GWs from many different sources. The sources can be broadly characterized as either transient or continuous in nature, and for each type, the analysis techniques depend on whether the gravitational waveforms can be accurately modeled or whether only less specific spectral characterizations are possible. We therefore organize the searches into four categories according to source type and analysis technique.
%(i) Transient, modeled waveforms: the compact binary coalescence search. The name follows from the fact that the best understood transient sources are the final stages of binary inspirals [52], where each component of the binary may be a NS or a BH. For these sources the waveform can be calculated with good precision, and matched-filter analysis can be used.
(ii) Transient, unmodeled waveforms: the gravitational-wave bursts search. Transient systems, such as core-collapse supernovae [53], BH mergers and NS quakes, may produce GW bursts that can only be modeled imperfectly, if at all, and more general analysis techniques are needed.
(iii) Continuous, narrow-band waveforms: the continuous wave sources search. An example of a continuous source of GWs with a well-modeled waveform is a spinning NS (e.g. a pulsar) that is not perfectly symmetric about its rotation axis [54].
(iv) Continuous, broadband waveforms: the gravitational-wave background search. Processes operating in the early universe, for example, could have produced a background of GWs that is continuous but stochastic in character [55].

\section{The TOROS Project}

In 2011, scientists from the Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy (CGWA) at 
The University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) 
and the Observatorio Astronomico de Cordoba (OAC) and Instituto de Astronomia Teorica y Experimental (IATE) (the last two in Argentina)
established the TOROS project
to scan likely areas of the localization uncertainty sky map of the GW trigger, looking for possible optical counterparts.
%to respond to the LVC GW triggers with a wide field search for possible optical counterparts in likely areas of the localization uncertainty sky map.

%Motivated by complementing the LIGO observations in the electromagnetic (EM) side, Dr. Mario Diaz from UT RGV founded the TOROS project. TOROS (the Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South), has the main goal of scanning the uncertainty region of the LIGO localization map for GW events, with a wide field telescope and a large CCD pixel camera, searching for EM transients candidates for counterparts for such GW event.

TOROS stands for Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South,
and its original project consisted in the construction of an observatory site in Cordon Macon,
a mountain top at 4637 m above sea level, in the Andes mountain range in the north of Argentina.

Cordon Macon is a location with high quality seeing and excellent photometric quality.
The mean and median of the seeing measurements obtained at Macon are 0.70'' and 0.55'', respectively (Renzi et al., 2009). 
Several sites within the area around Cordon Macon were considered for the location of the European Extremely Large Telescope, including a site on the Macon Ridge itself.
%It will also link the network of observatories to the sky in the Southern hemisphere.

The proposed TOROS telescope would have a 0.6 m aperture and a 9.85 sq. deg. field of view.
When fully operational it is planned to have three basic modes of operation:
follow up of GW triggers; 
follow up of gamma-ray burst triggers from Fermi, Swift, and other missions; 
and baseline imaging of the entire surveyable area.

It is also included in the full project the inclusion of a data reduction and processing pipeline for transient detection, as well as a database for the dissemination of catalogs and triggers.

While the original project remains on hold awaiting for proper financing of the facility, several other institutions showed interest to participate as well.
This broadened the TOROS project into a wider collaboration of telescopes instead of the single telescope in Argentina that was originally envisioned.

The collaboration has now partners in Mexico, and the Gemini spectrograph as well as the telescopes in Chile and Cordoba previously mentioned. \textcolor{red}{Use this paragraph to include all the participating institutions}

Whether it be the original design or the new dynamic proposed by the enlargement of the collaboration, the interesting targets to TOROS remain to be mergers with at least one Neutron Star (NS), because of its several radiation messengers.

Black Hole-Neutron Star (BH-NS) or Binary Neutron Stars (BNS) mergers are among the expected events detectable by the LVC. 
These highly energetic events will emit GW radiation in the frequency range of LIGO and Virgo sensitivity, strong enough to be detected up to a few hundreds Mpc of distance.
The precise maximum detection distance depends mainly of the masses involved in the merger, as well as other geometrical and spin parameters, but it sits at around 400 Mpc.

BNS and BH-NS mergers have long been proposed as the process leading to short-hard gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) (Eichler et al., 1989; Narayan et al., 1992), but unfortunately this emission is beamed and thus can only be observed in a small fraction of the events.

Mergers with NS are also predicted to be accompanied by a more isotropic EM counterpart, commonly known as a `Kilonova'. Kilonovae are day to week-long thermal, supernova-like transients, which are powered by the radioactive decay of heavy, neutron-rich elements synthesized in the expanding merger ejecta (Li \& Paczynski 1998). 

%Lattimer \& Schramm in 1974, were the first to propose a BH-NS merger as a suitable environment for the r-process and its radiation emission.

%Needless to say, is that Kilonovas are an ideal counterpart to the LIGO observations.
%We detail the reasons in the following paragraphs.

Kilonova emission is an ideal EM counterpart to the LIGO observations for the reasons we summarize in the following paragraphs.

As previously said, unlike SGRBs, Kilonova emission is isotropic. 
Even though short GRBs emission, is also present during the BNS merger, the r-process emission in the jet and other merger neutron ejecta, is fairly isotropic. The chances to detect the GRB jet are very limited by the collimation of the jet and our line of sight, but r-process radiation is not. 

The Kilonovae are bright.
It was based on their derived peak luminosities, of approximately 1,000 times brighter than a nova, that Metzger et al. (2010) first introduced the term `kilonova' to describe this EM counterparts.

Another fundamental element that the multi-messenger astronomy contributes with,
is the identification of host galaxies.
The inference of the distance to the GW event using redshift of host galaxy will greatly reduce degeneracy in the GW parameter estimation,
especially of the binary inclination with respect to the line of sight.
It will also give a better estimate of the energies involved in the merger.
Other interesting environment properties can be derived from the Kilonova detection, like age of the stellar population and possible displacements due to SN birth kicks.

But most importantly, the merger of a binary system involving a NS is very complex and several kind of factors can effect the radiation pattern and light-curve of the Kilonova as well as the GRW waveform. The optical light curve can serve as a probe into the core and shed light to the intricacies and details of the merge process.

For a more detailed explanation of the Kilonova and a possible detection in the infrared, please refer to chapter \ref{kilonovachapter}.

The next section is dedicated to the LVC O1 campaign and the TOROS participation on it.

\subsection{The O1 LIGO Campaign}

On April 2014, TOROS signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with the LIGO Virgo Collaboration, in order to participate in a program to perform follow-up observations of GW candidate events with the benefit of access to LVC proprietary information.

The MOU signing was a very important step that allowed TOROS to participate in the O1 LIGO campaign with positive results.
The MOU allowed TOROS to receive the LIGO alerts, which are private and confidential at the time of O1 and O2, and to be part of a publication as part of a broader collaboration with other institutions for the electromagnetic counterpart search of the first announced GW ever, namely GW150914.

Besides LIGO and Virgo Collaborations, other 24 institutions participated in the GW150914 event along with TOROS. These are detailed in table \ref{gw150914participants}.

\caption{Participating Institutions in the GW150914 EM Counterpart Search}
\label{gw150914participants}
\end{table}

Several other institutions showed interest in the project after this achievement and since then the collaboration has grown.

TOROS successfully participated of this campaign, where the first GW was detected, GW150914, and other two events with lower intensity were also detected, one in December ...

Surprisingly, the first of them, GW150914, was detected just before O1 officially began. It was during an engineering run. Despite the premature nature of the alert, TOROS could scan a region of the LIGO localization map and contribute with other XX observatories to the EM search. The search did not show up any transient associated with the event.

On the night of September 16, 2015, an LIGO alert for a GW arrived through the TOROS alert receiver system.

We conducted unfiltered CCD observations (0.35--1$\mu$m) with the 1.5-m telescope at Estacion Astronomica Bosque Alegre (EABA) telescope.

Because of the unexpected timing of the event, the alert was received 2 days later, and our observations started about 2.5 days after the alarm was received by LIGO.

This unexpected detection --observed four days before the first scientific run of the detectors was scheduled to start-- constituted the first detection of the merger of a binary black hole (BBH) system and the first direct detection of gravitational waves. Due to the unexpected timing of the event, LVC provided spatial location information two days later, in the form of probability sky maps via a private GCN circular (Singer 2015, GCN\#18330). TOROS was one of 25 teams that participated in the search for an electromagnetic counterpart search in the southern hemisphere.

On 2015 September 16, the LIGO Virgo Collaboration (LVC) provided two all-sky localization probability maps for the event, based on them.
Both, the coherent Wave Burst (cWB; Klimenko et al. 2016) and the Omicron+LALInference Burst (oLIB; Lynch et al. 2015) search for unmodeled signals. The first one, a rapid localization analysis just searches for coherent power across both detectors while the second one, more refined, assumes a Sine-Gaussian content. The maps provided initial spatial localization of 50\% and 90\% confidence regions encompassing about 200 and 750 square degrees, respectively (Singer 2015, GCN\#18330).

We started our imaging campaign immediately after
receiving, on the night of 2015 September 16, utilizing the
cWB map. Additional observations were obtained the
following night, and a second epoch of imaging was acquired on 2015 December 5 \& 6. We used an Apogee Alta
U9 camera with a field of view (FoV) of 12.'7 $\times$ 8.'5 and
an effective plate scale of 0.''75pix after 3 $\times$ 3 binning. Since we wished to maximize our sensitivity, we conducted unfiltered (``white light'') observations spanning 0.35 < $\lambda/\mu$m < 1. We obtained individual exposures of 60 s with a median seeing (FWHM) of (2.8 $\pm$ 0.6)''. 
We typically obtained 10 images per field, reaching 5$\sigma$ limiting magnitudes of r = 21.7 $\pm$ 0.3 mag.

The LIGO localization regions span several hundred square degrees (see Fig. 1) and vary depending on the algorithm. For instance, the 90\% credible localization area for cWB covers to 310 square degrees while others span up to 750 square degrees (see table 1 in Abbott et al. 2016c). Regardless, all sky maps are consistent with a broad long arc in the Southern hemisphere and a smaller extension in the Northern hemisphere. The algorithm utilized for the CWB estimations produces reasonably accurate maps for BBH signals, but underestimates the extent of high-confidence regions (Essick et al. 2015). As seen in Fig. 1, the adoption of maps from alternative algorithms (not available at the time our observations started) significantly reduces the fraction of the high-confidence region probed by our small FoV.

Despite the little area covered by TOROS, the O1 campaign allowed the collaboration to test the detection and response systems to the alerts.

\begin{comment}

With LIGO we have just pierced a new window in the purely relativistic universe.

LIGO is sensitive to phenomena in the 10Hz to 7kHz frequency band.

Similarly to the optical case, once other frequencies were explored more science could be done, with other detection methods like PTA (Pulsar Timing Array) and LISA will shed new light to other physical phenomena and physics.

Two things brought about radical changes in Astronomy: Multi-Messenger Astronomy and Time Domain Astronomy.

Sky location is ligo is very poor because it's based mainly on triangulation of detectors.
	Sky error regions are very large (e.g. $\approx$ 850 deg2 for GW150914; Abbott et al. 2016).
	With Virgo and KAGRA and INDIGO will be of of 10-100 square degrees or less (e.g., Fairhurst 2011, Nissanke et al. 2013, Rodriguez et al. 2014). 
	It still greatly exceeds the fields of view of most radio, optical, and X-ray telescopes.

Identifying host galaxies of GW is important. We can know:
	Age of stellar population.
	Displacement due to SN birth kicks.
	Determine distance to GW source. This reduces degeneracies in the GW parameter estimation, especially of the binary inclination with respect to the line of sight.

Based on their derived peak luminosities being approximately one thousand times brighter than a nova, Metzger et al. (2010) first introduced the term `kilonova' to describe the EM counterparts of NS mergers powered by the decay of r-process nuclei

It is known that short GRBs are basically NS-NS mergers.
GRB emission is collimated and jetted, so the chances to detect one along a GW are very low.
NS-NS also emit EM radiation of lower energy or frequency by a different process that occurs in the jet but is nonetheless isotropic. 

Observational (e.g., Fong et al. 2013) and theoretical (e.g. Eichler et al. 1989, Narayan et al. 1992) evidence suggest a relation between merges with at least one NS and the ``short duration'' class of GRBs (Nakar 2007, Berger 2014). 


[literal] Short GRBs are commonly believed to be powered by the accretion of a massive remnant disk onto the compact BH or NS remnant following the merger. This is typically expected to occur within seconds of the GW chirp, making their temporal association with the GWs unambiguous (the gamma-ray sky is otherwise quiet).

For the majority of GW-detected mergers, the jetted GRB emission will be relativistically beamed out of our line of sight.
The off-axis afterglow probably does not provide a promising counterpart for most observers

critical four-way connection between kilonovae, short GRBs, GWs from NS-NS/BH-NS mergers, and the astrophysical origin of the r-process nuclei. Metzger et al. (2010)

NS-NS/BH-NS mergers are also predicted to be accompanied by a more isotropic counterpart, commonly known as a `kilonova'. Kilonovae are day to week-long thermal, supernova-like transients, which are powered by the radioactive decay of heavy, neutron-rich elements synthesized in the expanding merger ejecta (Li \& Paczynski 1998). They provide both a robust EM counterpart to the GW chirp, which is expected to accompany a fraction of BH-NS mergers and essentially all NS-NS mergers, as well as a direct probe of the un- known astrophysical origin of the heaviest elements (e.g., Metzger et al. 2010).

The most significant of those is no doubt, the Kilonova emission produced by rapid capturing of neutrons.
Neutron capture has to be faster than the beta decay rate of the neutron and that's why it has to be rapid.
This capture process is called r-process. R is for rapid.
The r-process physics is quite complicated and involves a bunch of stuff, much of which is modeled to certain confidence, but many other elements are not well known. Several ingredients to the model are not considered fully. 

Blinnikov et al. (1984) and Paczynski (1986) first suggested a connection be- tween NS-NS mergers and GRBs.

Even prior to the discovery of the first binary pulsar (Hulse \& Taylor 1975), Lattimer \& Schramm (1974, 1976) proposed that the merger of compact star binaries --in particular the collision of BH-NS systems-- could give rise to the r-process by the decompression of highly neutron-rich ejecta (e.g. Meyer 1989). 

As compared to the earlier predictions (e.g. Metzger et al. 2010), these higher opacities push the bolometric light curve to peak later in time (1 week instead of a 1 day timescale), and at a lower luminosity (Barnes \& Kasen, 2013). More importantly, the enormous optical opacity caused by line blanketing moved the spectral peak from optical/UV frequencies to the near-infrared (NIR).

BH-BH mergers have no EM counterpart, except perhaps in very specific situations. This is mainly due to lack of baryonic matter.


TOROS, the Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South, is a collaboration formed to respond to GW events as detected by the LVC.
Its main purpose then is to detect transient events compatible with expected (or not) signatures of events that can give mutual birth to GW and optical triggers.

Being in its early stages of development, and given the new nature of the multi-messenger astronomy, the TOROS team is building up the tools and infrastructure that will make it capable in the future to promptly respond to this alerts.

Several things can enter in consideration for this task, from software development to forging ties with existing observatories. 

My thesis will focus on several challenges in the development of the software infrastructure needed to process the observatory data. 

At the moment of this writing, TOROS Collaboration consists of several astronomical institutions that showed interest in doing a search and possible follow-ups of candidates to interesting events.

The list of participant institutions is as follows: (should I list them?)

At UT Rio Grande Valley, we developed extensive analysis and web code to allow for the interaction between the institutions (just the broker page, really).

\chapter{Software Developed}
\section{Pipeline}

Since the ultimate goal of the TOROS Project is the robotization of the telescope,
it is important to have in place a software `pipeline' that accompanies the process
at all stages, from receiving the alert to propose new transient candidates.

The whole operation of TOROS processing can be divided in several stages (Tania ref)
as pictured in figure ??.

The first stage consists on ...

\subsection{Alert Receiver Robot}

The first step of the process starts with the alert receiver robot.

The alert receiver is hosted in a virtual machine server provided by UTRGV IT Services.
It is a Python script that runs uninterruptedly waiting for a signal from the 
GCN service of NASA delivered on a specific port reserved for this purpose.

The Gamma-Ray burst Coordinates Network (GCN) and the Transient Astronomy Network (TAN), collectively called the GCN/TAN network,
is a distribution network of transient events notices dependent on Goddard NASA.
As its name suggest it was primarily intended for the distribution of GRBs but also other transient notices
from Fermi and Swift spacecrafts to the rest of the Astronomy community. 
Most notices are sent in real-time, while the event is still ongoing, 
others are delayed due to telemetry down-link delays.

The subsequent reports of follow-up observations made by ground-based observers, are done by submitting circulars to that same site.
This makes the GCN/TAN network ``a one-stop shopping network for follow-up sites and GRB and transient researchers.''

The LIGO-Virgo Collaboration makes use of the GCN network to disseminate the event
notices to the participating observatories searching for EM counterparts.

The notice comes in the form of a Virtual Observatory Event (VOE) file,
and it is distributed as a message to predefined static IPs and ports,
using the VOEvent Transport Protocol.

\textcolor{blue}{VOEvent is an IVOA Recommendation -- that is, it has been adopted as an international standard. As with many other IVOA standards, VOEvent is based on XML, the Extensible Markup Language [9]. XML is ubiquitous in worldwide web technologies and simply provides a structured way to build a nested hierarchy of elements, to attach attributes to those elements, and to assign values to each. An additional constraint on many IVOA standards, including VOEvent, is a schema to apply rules on the arrangement and numbers of each element and attribute and on their allowed values. XML Schema [10] can be an often-entertaining technology for the designers of a standard. Providing a battle-hardened VOEvent schema [11] is a priority of the VOEvent v2.0 development effort. A well-crafted schema permits the validation of documents (in this case VOEvent messages, also referred to as ``packets'') against the requirements of the standard, and can even be used to automatically create software to parse such messages.}

The VOEvent Transport Protocol is a simple TCP-based protocol for transporting VOEvent messages from authors, through brokers, to subscribers.

VOEvent is the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) recommended mechanism for describing astronomical transients.
According to its main website \footnote{\href{http://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/IvoaVOEvent}{http://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/IvoaVOEvent}},
it is an XML file notice that ``{\em defines the content and meaning of a standard information packet for representing, transmitting, publishing and archiving information about a transient celestial event, with the implication that timely follow-up is of interest.}'' 

In our case, we registered two static IPs with GCN, one in Texas at UT RGV and another one for Cordoba in Argentina at IATE Institute.
Only the one in Texas is functional at the moment, while the one in Cordoba is receiving but has problems sending out emails.

The VOEvent is received by a continuously running script that listens on the specific port and creates an alert email involving the heads and some staff at each TOROS partner.

The listening is done mainly by the PyGCN module developed by Leo Singer, which handles the reception GCN notices from LVC. The rest of email sending is done by usual Python tools for that task.

Right now, the script does a minimum process to deliver the XML body of the VOEvent by email to predetermined recipients.
Future improvements on this side should include the automatic download of the skymaps
to be attached to the email along with the VO Event notice.

It could also pre-process the skymap to extract most likely galaxy hosts for observing targets.

Right now, this is done on a separate script that requires human intervention.

\subsection{Target Selection}

As mentioned before, the target selection is done with a separate script.
This script makes use of the sky-map provided in the alert notice and the 
Gravitational Waves Galaxy Catalog (GWGGC) (A List of Galaxies for Gravitational Wave Searches, Darren J. White et al, 2011)

The White's catalog is a homogeneous list of 53,255 galaxies within 100Mpc.
It is a compilation from 4 different catalogs: an updated version of the Tully Nearby Galaxy Catalog,
the Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies, the V8k catalogue and HyperLEDA.

GWGC contains information on sky position, distance, blue magnitude, major and minor diameters, position angle, and galaxy type.
Also included in the catalog are 150 Milky Way globular clusters.

The authors claim (ref) that GWGC is more complete --within 100 Mpc-- than other catalogs,
due to their use of more up-to-date input catalogs
and the fact that they don't make a blue luminosity cut.

Another catalog along these lines is the Glade GW Catalog. Glade Catalog has xxxx galaxies listed, this many more than CWGC and extends up to XX Mpc.
Nonetheless many distances are inferred by Machine Learning Methods, and completitude of the Catalog... bla bla

The target selection is based on two main criteria: the localization (un)certainty on the target pixel in the all-sky map given by LIGO at the time of the alert,
and several filter cuts on distance, blue luminosity and apparent magnitude.

This marriage between GW and Optical parameters of observability ensures the targets are visible at each telescope site, and that they have some significant probability of being the host.
The list of filter cuts are summarized in table \ref{obsfilters}.

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
  \hline
 Parameter & Limit value \\ \hline
Observability from location & $30^{\circ} > \delta > -70^{\circ}$ for EABA \\ \hline
Apparent Magnitude & $B \le 21$ mag \\ \hline
Distance  & $D < 60$ Mpc \\ \hline
Absolute Magnitude & $MB \le -21$ mag \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Parameter Cuts}
\label{obsfilters}
\end{table}

\subsection{The Broker Website}

Once the list of targets is done, we need to communicate the targets to each telescope.
This is done through a broker website written in Django.
Each telescope representative has assigned a username and password to access a website hosted on UTRGV servers.
This website has a simple interface of tables for each observatory and a list of targets observable from each location, obtained by the target selection method on the previous step.

Each telescope admin then selects targets from the list, to reserve them for his or her observatory. 
The website enforces that the list of targets be unique and that no two observatories are observing the same target.
It does so, by ignoring targets previously selected by others on the query.

Each observatory then carries the observations for the successive nights and file a report of the observations when these are done.

The website can also output a circular draft of all the targets observed by each telescope to be submitted to the GCN/TAN website for the rest of the community.

\subsection{Further Processing}

The previous steps are the normal workflow for the operations on a LIGO campaign.

The pipeline is not fully automatized or optimized for all of the stages, and there are still gaps where human intervention is needed.
Most notably is the target selction or scheduling, and the loading of the observation targets to the broker website.
Making them automatic, would require a REST framework on the Django website and a transfer protocol mechanism,
which are beyond the computational abilities of who writes this thesis.
It is my hope that the software developed so far could be picked up by a web developer that can connect the parts in a seamless way.

The pipeline is written entirely in Python, following the latest trend in Astronomy.
For the web pages developed to support the collaboration, we used the popular Python web framework Django
and a light database on Sqlite 3.

Sqlite provides a lightweight database solution that does not require complex server-client operations, and it stores all data in a simple file.
Thus, the database is easy to browse and modify.
The database handles information for the GW Galaxy Catalog, the user information as well as permissions and login information,
Observatories data.

The following stages of the pipeline deal with the specific analysis to identify candidates to optical counterparts of GW.

The first part deals with the Difference Image Analysis.
For that two images, one taken at the epoch of interest and another one used as a reference. Ideally, the reference is an archive image or a stack of several others to improve signal to noise ratio, cosmic rays and other contaminants on the image.

In the case for our campaign for O1, we had to use a-posteriori references taken a few months after the event.

Before performing the subtraction, both images have to be aligned pixel by pixel.
Software to perform the alignments was done using a method described in section \ref{astroalign_section}.
I describe there a method based on asterism matching inspired in astrometry.net.

The subtraction methods are explained in section \ref{ois_section}.
Several algorithms are explained in the literature with a wide range of methods, from Fourier Transform, to PSF matching to using Information Theory.
Some of them are explained and implemented in a Python module named `ois' developed by me for this project.

\textcolor{blue}{While machines are capable of many types of information processing, they are not so good where something new is present that has not been programmed. Certainly we expect the future flood of events to be mostly handled by machines, with the uninteresting ones never seen by a human expert, but some may be escalated in importance and come to the attention of such experts through a message, or even being urgently awoken in the night.}

\textcolor{blue}{There could be a large number of other people also involved in the enterprise, volunteers recruited from the internet, with some, but by no means expert, ability. All people have excellent image analysis capabilities: they could, for example, look at an image of a star field and determine quickly and accurately if there is an artifact, such as a satellite trail, interference from a nearby bright star, or one of many Earthbound artifacts: from the telescope, camera, or electronics. While many of these types of common artifacts can be detected by machine, there are always new types, or artifacts that are a combination of known types. Since the transient detection software is looking for differences between new and past observations, such artifacts, though rare, will be inevitably found and thus pollute the event stream.}

\textcolor{blue}{This type of `citizen science' has been both popular and extremely useful in GalaxyZoo[6] and CitizenSky[7], and we expect it to be the same with events. A new aspect with events, different from the traditional web-based citizen science, could be that events are `pushed' to the volunteers, so they can respond with their mobile device immediately. Another novel aspect to citizen science could be the recruiting of a cadre of dedicated volunteers to work at a more expert level, looking at light curves or other non-image data; they would need to be sufficiently motivated to study and take a test, to be inducted to this higher level.}

\textcolor{blue}{Given that there will be tens of thousands of transient candidates competing for scarce resources, it is impossible to eyeball even those that survive the myriad of classification steps mentioned earlier. Human neural networks can come to the rescue in such a case. Details about citizen science are provided elsewhere in this book. Here we would like to highlight one particular aspect, the synergy between machine learning and human pattern recognition expertise to improve the machine learning methodologies.}

It is worth mentioning that the web server also hosts a related project `winnow', a web interface to manually classify potential transients
on subtraction images, by voting on `real' or `bogus' categories. 
This voting allows to have good training sets to later train automatic classifiers to do the same task.
The website was tested successfully with many undergraduate and graduate students, 
and there are plans to apply it to high-school students as a way of citizen science project.

\section{Optimal Image Subtraction} \label{ois_section}
	
OIS (Optimal Image Subtraction) is a Python module that implements several Difference Image Analysis methods as described in section X.

It works on Numpy arrays, so that way is agnostic on the origin of the image. 

Bad pixels that need to be ignored in the image are marked using Numpy's masked arrays (True on bad pixel).

The interface to the user has two entry points: the module methods optimal\_system and subtract\_on\_grid. The latter is just a convenient method to partition the image in a certain grid and perform the former on each grid, taking into account pixels outside the grid when necessary.

optimal\_system will return ...

OIS has documentation on the popular documentation site readthedocs.io.

\chapter{Derivation of the Gravitational Wave Equations} \label{gwderivation}

Gravitational waves are a particular kind of solution to the Einstein's field equations of General Relativity.

In many situations we can consider, we are in a flat background situation, in which our metric does not differ much locally from the Minkowski metric.
Suppose we are far away, removed from any strong source in an asymptotically flat spacetime.

In such situation we can assume that locally our metric is the Minkowski metric $\eta$ plus some small deviation $h$. We want to study the dynamics of such small perturbation in a linearized Einstein field equation. 


To do that, we consider the metric $g = \eta + h$ in the linearized Einstein's field equations. Linearized here means that quadratic and higher factors of $h$ will be simply ignored, as they are assumed much smaller than the flat metric.

Let's find out what condition the Einstein field equation $G_{\mu \nu}(\eta + h) = 8\pi T_{\mu \nu} = 0$ imposes on this small perturbation $h$.

%\begin{align}
%G_{\mu \nu}(\eta + h) = 8\pi T_{\mu \nu} = 0
%\end{align}

%It is worth noting here that Einstein equations are not linear in nature, but they are second order on the metric derivatives and furthermore linear on the second order terms. This will allow us to derive from the linearized Einstein equations, a second order wave equation on the small perturbation $h$ that decouples from $\eta$.

%Another issue to point out is that the vague definition of 'small perturbation' has to be of physical nature and not an artifact on the choice of the coordinate system. We will not worry about this issue on the present work, but it is worth keeping it in mind. Other concerns about coordinate system effects were historically raised and settled in time, particularly the many gauge choices done during the derivation.

The Christoffel symbols to first order in $h$ are:

\begin{align}
\Gamma_{abc} &= \frac{1}{2} \left( g_{ca,b} + g_{cb,a} - g_{ab,c} \right) \\
  &= \frac{1}{2} \left( (\eta + h)_{ca,b} + (\eta + h)_{cb,a} - (\eta + h)_{ab,c} \right) \\
 &=\frac{1}{2} \left( h_{ca,b} + h_{cb,a} - h_{ab,c} \right) 
\end{align}

At this point we must note that we will still call $g^{ab}$ the inverse of $g_{ab}$, which is $g^{ab} = \eta^{ab} - h^{ab}$ to first order in $h$. 

And thus,
\begin{align}
\Gamma^{a}_{bc} &= g^{cd} \Gamma_{abd} \\
 &=(\eta - h)^{cd} \Gamma_{abd} \\
 &= \frac{1}{2} \eta^{cd} \left( h_{ca,b} + h_{cb,a} - h_{ab,c} \right) + \order(h^2)
\end{align}

Similarly, the Ricci tensor to first order in $h$ will be:

\begin{align}
R_{ab} &= \Gamma^{c}_{ab,c} - \Gamma^{c}_{cb,a} \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left( h_{a}{}^{c}{}_{,bc} + h_{b}{}^{c}{}_{,ac} - h_{ab,c}{}^{c} - h_{c}{}^{c}{}_{,ab} \right)
\end{align}

Which will finally lead us to the Einstein's tensor $G$:

\begin{align}
G_{ab} &= R_{ab} - \frac{1}{2}g_{ab}R \\
&= R_{ab} - \frac{1}{2}\eta_{ab}R + \order(h^2) \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \left( h_{ac,b}{}^{c} + h_{bc,a}{}^{c} - h_{ab,c}{}^{c} - h_{c}{}^{c}{}_{,ab} -\eta_{ab} \left( h_{cd,}{}^{cd} - h_{c}{}^{c}{}_{,d}{}^{d} \right) \right)
\end{align}

This can be brought to a shorter form defining $\bar{h}{}_{ab} = h_{ab} - \eta_{ab} h$

Where $h = h_{c}{}^{c}$ is the trace of the metric tensor $h$.
With this definition, the Einstein's field equation becomes:

\begin{align}
\bar{h}{}_{ab,c}{}^{c} + \bar{h}{}_{ac,b}{}^{c} + \bar{h}{}_{bc,a}{}^{c} -\eta_{ab} \bar{h}{}_{cd,}{}^{cd} = 0
\end{align}

\section{Gauge choices}

There is a gauge freedom in General Relativity corresponding to the group of diffeomorphisms, that can be used to simplify the equations even more. Just like the Gauge freedom in electrodynamics $A \rightarrow A + \partial \chi$ we can chose $h$ to satisfy $\bar{h}{}_{ab,}{}^{b} = 0$

In this ``Lorentz Gauge'', the linearized Einstein field equations, reduce to the usual wave equation for each component of $\bar{h}$:

\begin{align}
\bar{h}_{ab,c}{}^{c} = \Box{\bar{h}{}_{ab}} = 0
\end{align}

Further gauge choices can let us choose the trace of $\bar{h}$ to be zero and each $h_{0\mu}$ component to be zero for $\mu = 0,1,2,3$. Notice that once the trace of $\bar{h}$ is set to zero, it implies that $\bar{h}{}_{ab} = h_{ab}$

\begin{align} \label{gaugecond}
& \Box{h_{ab}} = 0 \\
& h_{ab,}{}^{b} = 0 \\
& h_{a}{}^{a} = 0 \\
& h_{0 \mu} = 0; \; \mu=0,1,2,3
\end{align}

This is called the transverse traceless (TT) gauge. The reader can refer the full derivation for the gauge choices in Misner or Wald.

With the conditions in (\ref{gaugecond}), we seek solutions in the form of plane waves of the form $h_{ab} = H_{ab}e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}}$.

Our gauge conditions impose similar conditions on $k$ and $H$:

\begin{align}
& k^{\mu} H_{\mu \nu} = 0 \\
& H_{\mu}{}^{\mu} = 0 \\
& H_{0 \mu} = 0; \; \mu=0,1,2,3
\end{align}

This leaves $H$ with only two independent components. If we consider a wave propagating in the z direction, the most general form for a transverse traceless metric will be:

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & h_{+} & h_{\times} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} & -h_{+} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}}
\end{equation}

and the total metric $g$

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 + h_{+}e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & h_{\times} e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 0 \\
0 & h_{\times} e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 1 - h_{+}e^{\pm \imath k_{\mu}x^{\mu}} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The two independent polarizations are called ``h plus'' ($h_+$) and ``h cross'' ($h_{\times}$).
