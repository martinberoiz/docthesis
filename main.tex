\chapter{Introduction}

After 100 years after the prediction of gravitational waves (GW from hereon)

\section*{The LIGO Project}
* Lengthy LIGO Description

\section*{Multi-Messenger Astronomy}
* The raise of and need for multi messenger astronomy

\section*{The TOROS Collaboration (or project?)}
* Lengthy TOROS Description (whatever it evolved into at this point)

TOROS, the Transient Optical Robotic Observatory of the South, is a collaboration formed to respond to GW events as detected by the LVC.
Its main purpose then is to detect transient events compatible with expected (or not) signatures of events that can give mutual birth to GW and optical triggers.

Being in its early stages of development, and given the new nature of the multimessenger astronomy, the TOROS team is building up the tools and infrastructure that will make it capable in the future to promptly respond to this alerts.

Several things can enter in consideration for this task, from software development to forging ties with existing observatories. 

My thesis will focus on several challenges in the development of the software infrastructure needed to process the observatory data. 

At the moment of this writing, TOROS Collaboration consists of several astronomical institutions that showed interest in doing a search and possible follow-ups of candidates to interesting events.

The list of participant institutions is as follows: (should I list them?)

At UT Rio Grande Valley, we developed extensive analysis and web code to allow for the interaction between the institutions (just the broker page, really). 



\section*{The Transient World}

\section{The Time-Domain Revolution in Astronomy}
* GW20150914 and our contribution

* The transient world
	* The Time Domain revolution in Astronomy
	* What are transients and which ones are we interested in

	* How can we catch transients
		* Previous work: Catalog Matching: Marica's pipeline and Shuang's work on the transient identification and comparison to my OIS code.
		* Previous work: OIS + ML (the iPTF experience)
		* Subsection on ML (Supervised vs. Unsupervised, overall view and some popular algorithms)
		* Discussion of both methods


\include{chapter_DIA/chapter}


\chapter{Machine Learning}
\section{Our test-drive with OIS + ML}
	* Our test-drive with OIS + ML. Results of paper (hopefully)
		* Test data we used (CSTAR)
		* Processing our raw data (selecting images for a dataset, cleaning images, fixing headers, performing subtractions, identifying sources in subtractions, stamps)
		* Getting samples for training (labelling data as RB, winnow, first run of ML)
		* Feature exploration of data (SExtractor features, derived features, morphological features like Zernike, Chebyshev, Fourier, etc.)
		* Random Forest + SMOTE + Cost Matrix (how well did this perform?)
		* Is it reproducible in other data sets?
		
\section{Software Developed}
\subsection{Corral Pipeline Framework}

\include{chapter_astroalign/chapter}


\section{Optimal Image Subtraction}
* Explanation Tools Developed (This would be a whole chapter)
	* Pipeline Framework (corral)
	* Reduction module for images
	* Spin-off packages relevant to the Python astronomical community: *astroalign* and *ois* (Optimal Image Subtraction, name can change in the future)
	
\chapter{Conclusions}
* The future of LIGO, TOROS and multi messenger astronomy


\appendix

\chapter{Notations }

Here we show the use of multiple appendixes.

\section{Math Notations}

Each appendix can have sub-sections as a regular chapter.


\section{Additional Notations}


\chapter{Ontologies}

These is another appendix.
